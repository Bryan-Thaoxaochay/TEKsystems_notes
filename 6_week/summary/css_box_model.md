# CSS Box Model
*Every element in HTML has a set amount of space that it can take*
- this space is broken down into 4 parts:
  1. Content
    - the space that the content will take
  3. Padding
    - the space outside of the content, but inside the border
  5. Border
    - the space outside of the padding, but inside the margin
  7. Margin
    - the space outside the margin  

*Things to Remember*
- if the border is too close to the content, increase the padding
- if an element is too close to another element, increase the margin
