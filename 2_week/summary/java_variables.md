# Variables
Syntax
```
datatype varName = value;

double radius = 20;
String hello = "hello";
```
- given value null if no value assigned

## Constants
Syntax
```
final datatype CONSTANT_NAME = value;
```  

## Statically Typed
Java is a statically typed language
- every var needs a datatype declared w/ it
- a var cannot hold data that doesn't match its datatype  

**This helps the compiler run faster because datatype deals w/ memory**
