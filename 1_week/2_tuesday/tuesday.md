# Week 1: Tuesday - Agile Methodology
## Issues w/ SDLC
- All requirements are known and none of it will change
- Starting to implementation can take too long, months to years even when everything goes well
- If requirements change, the timing and budget of the project can change drastically
  
## Agile Manifesto (values + principles)
- an approach to software development, w/ a set of values and principles  
  
The Purpose: helps us solve issues related to SDLC  

### Values
- Individuals + Interactions > Processes + Tools  
The plan to build an app changes w/ the individuals in the team  
  
- Working software > Comprehensive documentation  
?  
  
- Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation  
Satisfy the customer needs first and foremost, even if the budget and time needs to change  
  
- Responding to change > Following a plan  
Your plan needs to be flexible

*Choose the values on the left*  
  
### Principles
1. Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
1. Deliver working software frequently, w/ preference to a shorter timescale
1. Business people and developers must work together frequently
1. Build projects around motivated individuals
1. Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient way of transferring information
1. Working software is the main measure of progress
1. Agile processes promote sustainable development. Constant pace is preferred.
1. Pay attention to technical excellence and good design to improve agility
1. Simplicity is essential - maximize the amount of work not done
1. Self-organizing teams produce the best architecture, requirements, and designs
1. Team is changing throughout the process to also become more efficient  
  
### Frameworks w/ Agile
- Kanban
- Scrum
- Extreme Programming
- Crystal
- DSDM
- LSD
- FDD  
  
## Scrum
- framework that aligns w/ the Agile principles

### Scrum Theory
- knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known  
  
**3 Pillars of Scrum**  
- Transparency  
Everyone in the team understands what is happening and what the plan is  
  
- Inspection  
Checking your work as you do it, and determine if anything needs to change for the better  
  
- Adaptation  
Being able to change based on the results of the inspection  
  
### Scrum Values
Primary focus is on the work of the Sprint, to do their best work possible
- Commitment
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect
- Courage  
  
### Scrum Roles
- Scrum Master  
Coach of the team, helping the team perform at the highest level by using the scrum process  

- Product Owner  
Represents the business, creating user stories that prioritize acceptance criteria and controlling the backlog

- Development Team  
Coders, testers, and anyone else working on the tasks in the Sprint
  
### Artifacts of Scrum
- Product Backlog: Epics + User Stories not in the Sprint
- Sprint Backlog: User stories to be worked in a Sprint
- Increment: Body of work accepted by product owner at the end of a sprint  
a. Scrum team and stakeholders have an understanding of when the work is done
  
Epic - big chunk of work w/ 1 common objective  
User Story - describing a software feature from the user-perspective  
- type of user
- what they want
- why they want it
- As a (role), I want to (action) so that (reason)
- **user stories are not dependent on other use stories**

Task - smaller work items to break a story into smaller units

### Scrum Events
1. Sprint Planning - selecting user stories from product backlog
1. Daily Scrum - daily meetings w/ updates
1. Sprint Review - demonstrating developed software and seeking product owner's acceptance
1. Retrospective Meeting - analysis and inspection of the Sprint that just ended  
  
### Further Actions in a Scrum
- Story Points - measure the amount of time needed to complete a task
- Burndown Chart - comparing the expected decrease of story points to the actual decrease of story points  
a. this determines if the tasks are on track to be completed during the sprint  
- Velocity - sum of story points completed over 1 sprint  
a. used to determine how many story points to consider in future sprints

### Sprints
- a set amount of time given to complete a task(s)
- around 2-4 weeks
- each sprint usually focuses on a specific feature

### Process for a Sprint
1. Product backlog is filled with epics and user stories
1. The team selects what epics and user stories will be completed in the current sprint
1. Those epics and user stories are further broken down and clarified if needed, for better understanding
1. Those epics and user stories are now considered the Sprint backlog
1. The user stories that are finished and improved are referred to as the Increment  
  
Sprint Goal  
- objective to be met within the Sprint
- the purpose behind building the increments
- Why?  
a. makes the Dev team work together  
b. we can't do any changes that would affect the Sprint Goal  
c. if the sprint goal becomes obselete, the sprint should be cancelled
