# Software Development Life Cycle
- process used to create high-quality software
1. Exceeds customer expectations
2. Reaches completion within time and cost estimates  
  
Teams Involved:
- Client: the people who the software is being built for
- Project Team: the people communicating w/ the client and those building the software

## Stages of SDLC
### 1. Requirement Analysis
This stage is split into 2 more stages:
- Business Analysis
- Requirement Gathering  
  
#### Business Analysis
*Where are we now?*
- what is the purpose of this software?
- when do they need it?
- what is the budget?
- what are the risks?  

**Try to understand the current situation**  
  
#### Requirement Gathering **(MOST IMPORTANT STAGE IN SDLC)**
*What are we building?*
- gather info from the customer to know what they want and how they want it used  
  
Questions to ask  
- who will use this product?
- how will the customer use this product?
- **what do we need to have?**
- **what do we want to have?**
- **what is just gravy?**  
  
**Make sure the requirements are CLEAR**  
  
### 2. Design
*How do we build it?*  
- illustrate the flow of the application  
  
SRS Document - document describing what the software will do  
- Function Requirement Documents (FRD): describes the user stories and workflows of the application  
- Non-Functional Requirement Documents (Non FRD): define the system attributes: security, reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and usability  
  
**Client signs off on the SRS document, then the proposal, then we move onto the next phase: Coding**  
  
### 3. Coding / Implementation / Development
*Let's make it happen!*  
- Coding begins, following the functional and non-functional requirements that were defined in previous stages  
  
**It is extremely important that the requirements were done right, so we don't have to do too much back and forth work**  
  
### 4. Testing
*Is the software of good quality?*  
- does it pass all the tests?
  
Software Quality - how well the product meets the requirements  
Fit-for-Use - how useful is the product from the user perspective  
  
### 5. Deployment
*Go Live*  
It is time to deploy the application!  
- Even if an application passes all the tests, there is still the possibility of failure. Therefore, tests are still ran.  
  
### 6. Maintenance
**An application is never finished**. This stage is an ongoing process and involves:
- fixes
- upgrades
- improvements
- monitoring  
  
## House Analogy: Building a New House
1. Requirements Analysis  
a. Business Analysis (current situation)  
- family size
- current number of rooms
- square feet
- current number of bathrooms
- current parking space
- neighborhood
- rent
- housing  
  
b. Requirements Gathering  
- What do you need?
- What do you want?
- What would you like to have, but not necessarily need?  

2. Design  
Sketch a layout that fits all your requirements  

3. Coding / Implementation  
BUILD YOUR HOUSE!  

4. Testing  
Make sure your house is safe for everyone  

5. Deployment  
Live in your house!  

6. Maintenance  
Keep your house alive and up-to-date, to avoid future issues  
  
## Issues w/ SDLC
- All requirements have to be known and none of it can change
- Starting to implementation can take too long, months to years even when everything goes well
- If requirements change, the timing and budget of the project can change drastically
