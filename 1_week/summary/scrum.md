## 3 Pillars of Scrum
- Transparency  
Everyone knows what they are doing, have to do, and why  

- Inspection  
Checking your work as you do it and determine if anything needs to change for the better  

- Adaptation  
Being able to change based on the results of the inspection  

## Values
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect
- Courage
- Commitment  

## Scrum Roles
- Scrum Master  
Coach of the team, helping the team perform at the highest level by using the scrum process  

- Product Owner  
Represents the business, creating user stories that prioritize acceptance criteria and controlling the backlog

- Development Team  
Coders, testers, and anyone else working on the tasks in the Sprint  

## Artifacts of Scrum
- Product Backlog: Epics + User Stories not in the Sprint  
Epic - big chunk of work w/ 1 common objective  
User Story - describing a software feature from the user-perspective  
a. **As a (role), I want to (action) so that (reason)**  
b. type of user  
c. what they want  
d. why they want it  
**USER STORIES SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON OTHER USER STORIES**  
Task - smaller work items that a user story can be broken down into  

- Sprint Backlog: User stories to be worked in a Sprint  

- Increment: Body of work accepted by product owner at the end of a sprint  
Scrum team and stakeholders have an understanding of when the work is done  

## Scrum Events
1. Sprint - a set amount of time given to complete user stories  
a. around 2-4 weeks  
b. focused around a specific feature
1. Sprint Planning - selecting user stories from product backlog
1. Daily Scrum - daily meetings w/ updates
1. Sprint Review - demonstrating developed software and seeking product owner's acceptance
1. Retrospective Meeting - analysis and inspection of the Sprint that just ended  

### Further Events
- Story Points - measure the amount of time needed to complete a task
- Burndown Chart - comparing the expected decrease of story points to the actual decrease of story points  
a. this determines if the tasks are on track to be completed during the sprint  
- Velocity - sum of story points completed over 1 sprint  
a. used to determine how many story points to consider in future sprints  

### Sprint
#### Sprint Goal
- objective to be met within the Sprint  

Why have a goal?
- makes the Dev team work together  

What is the importance of the sprint goal?
- we can't do any changes that would affect the Sprint Goal  
- if the sprint goal becomes obselete, the sprint should be cancelled  

#### Sprint Process
1. Product backlog is filled with epics, user stories, and tasks
1. The team selects what user stories and tasks will be completed in the current sprint
1. Those user stories and tasks are now considered the Sprint backlog
1. The user stories and tasks that are finished and approved are referred to as the Increment
